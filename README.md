## Introduction

This repository is a collection of my deep learning projects and experiments. It includes implementations of different neural network architectures, solutions to common deep learning tasks, and notes on theoretical concepts. The goal is to build a comprehensive understanding of deep learning through hands-on practice and experimentation.

## Projects

### 1. MNIST Digit Classification
Implementation of a neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Folder**: `mnist-digit-classification`
- **Description**: Trains a neural network to classify images of handwritten digits.
- **Technologies**: TensorFlow, Keras, Python
- **Notebook**: [MNIST_Digit_Classification.ipynb](mnist-digit-classification/MNIST_Digit_Classification.ipynb)

### 2. Image Classification with CNNs
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Folder**: `image-classification-cnn`
- **Description**: Trains CNN models to classify images into 10 different categories.

## Installation

To set up the environment and run the notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/deep-learning-journey.git
    cd deep-learning-journey
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the notebooks:

1. **Activate the virtual environment** (if not already activated):
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

2. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. **Open the desired notebook** from the Jupyter interface and run the cells.
