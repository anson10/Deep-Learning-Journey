# Traffic Sign Classification

**[Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign)**

## Dataset Overview

The dataset is organized into three main directories:

1. **Train**: 
    - This directory contains subdirectories where each subdirectory represents a different class of traffic signs.
    - The images within each subdirectory correspond to that particular class.
    - The name of each subdirectory typically serves as the label for the images it contains.
    - **Example Structure**:
        ```
        Train/
        ├── Class1/
        │   ├── image1.png
        │   ├── image2.png
        │   └── ...
        ├── Class2/
        │   ├── image1.png
        │   └── ...
        └── ...
        ```

2. **Test**: 
    - This directory contains images that are used to evaluate the performance of the model.
    - The images in this directory are not labeled, and the objective is to predict their corresponding classes using the trained model.
    - **Example Structure**:
        ```
        Test/
        ├── image1.png
        ├── image2.png
        └── ...
        ```

3. **Meta**: 
    - This directory contains metadata related to the dataset. 
    - The metadata might include a CSV file with additional information about the classes, labels, or any other relevant data.
    - **Example Structure**:
        ```
        Meta/
        └── meta_file.csv
        ```

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify traffic signs into their respective categories. The model will be trained on the labeled images from the `Train` directory and evaluated using the images from the `Test` directory.

## Approach

### 1. **Data Loading**
   - The images from the `Train` and `Test` directories will be loaded into memory.
   - Each image in the `Train` directory will be associated with a label based on the name of the subdirectory it resides in.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - **Resizing**: All images will be resized to a standard size (e.g., 32x32 pixels) to ensure consistency.
   - **Normalization**: Pixel values will be normalized to the range [0, 1] to improve model performance.
   - **Label Encoding**: The string labels will be converted into numerical format, and one-hot encoding will be applied.

### 3. **Model Development**
   - A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) will be designed to perform the classification task.
   - The model will consist of several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers, and fully connected layers leading to the output layer.

### 4. **Training the Model**
   - The model will be trained on the preprocessed data from the `Train` directory.
   - A portion of the training data will be set aside as a validation set to monitor the model's performance during training.

### 5. **Evaluation**
   - After training, the model will be evaluated on the images from the `Test` directory.
   - The model's performance will be measured in terms of accuracy, and a confusion matrix will be used to analyze the classification results.

### 6. **Deployment**
   - The trained model can be deployed in a web application where users can upload images of traffic signs, and the model will predict the corresponding class.

## Conclusion

This project aims to develop a robust and accurate traffic sign classification model that can be used in real-world applications, such as autonomous vehicles or traffic monitoring systems. By leveraging CNNs and a well-structured dataset, we can achieve high accuracy in recognizing and classifying various traffic signs.
