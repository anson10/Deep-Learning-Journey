# Character-Level Recurrent Sequence-to-Sequence Model

## Overview

This project implements a **character-level recurrent sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model**. The model is designed to process input sequences of characters and produce corresponding output sequences. Seq2seq models are widely used in tasks such as machine translation, text summarization, and speech recognition. By working at the character level, the model can generalize better to unseen words and languages.

## Features
- Character-level tokenization.
- Encoder-Decoder architecture using recurrent neural networks (RNNs).
- Attention mechanism to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during decoding.
- Flexible for tasks like text normalization, transliteration, and language modeling.

## Architecture

### 1. **Encoder**
The encoder processes the input sequence one character at a time and encodes it into a fixed-length context vector. It consists of:
- An embedding layer to convert character indices into dense vector representations.
- A recurrent layer (e.g., LSTM or GRU) to capture temporal dependencies in the sequence.

### 2. **Decoder**
The decoder generates the output sequence character by character. It consists of:
- An embedding layer for the output characters.
- A recurrent layer for generating predictions.
- A softmax layer to compute probabilities over the output character vocabulary.

### 3. **Attention Mechanism**
Attention allows the decoder to focus on different parts of the input sequence at each decoding step. This is especially helpful for long sequences.

### Model Flow
1. Input sequence -> Encoder -> Context vector.
2. Context vector -> Attention mechanism -> Decoder.
3. Decoder -> Output sequence (character by character).

## Dataset

The model requires paired sequences for training, where each pair consists of:
- An input sequence (e.g., text in one language).
- A corresponding output sequence (e.g., text in another language).

### Example Dataset
For character-level machine translation from English to German:
```
Input:  hello
Output: hallo
```

## Training

### Hyperparameters
- Embedding Dimension: 128

### Training Procedure
1. Load and preprocess the dataset.
2. Tokenize the input and output sequences at the character level.
3. Train the model using teacher forcing to improve convergence.
4. Save the trained model for inference.

## Evaluation

### Metrics
